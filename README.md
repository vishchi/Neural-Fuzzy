# Neural-Fuzzy

This is an academic project intended to develop a simple fuzzy decision tree based classifier,
which classifies the car feature based on other features, like for example:
Initially, I give six columns(features) of dataset as input namely mpg,cyl,disp,hp,drat,wt. 
Once it reads the data and trains the tree, I further ask it to predict an another column's data of same row that was not given as an input.
It predicts with an accuracy that decreases with an increase in data because of Decision Tree mechanism that's involved.
